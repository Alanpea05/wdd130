      <p>
        Taná was creating because we think that we have to change the way men fashion
        works, we can see fashion in women change a lot every year, that’s how this 
        idea borned, we visited a lot of renters locals of ties and suits, and we 
        realize they have the same style, they don’t have any novelty, even we found
         the same ties to rent and sell, Taná helps Mexican traditions to grow creating new designs of men fashion based on traditions and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The principals designs are from a little Town in Larrainzar, Chiapas, where the idea came to us, 
        one of the main activities there is embroider and create crafts to sell, but they don’t have a lot 
        of market, we had the opportunity to know them and we want to help them and also make known the 
        beauty of their culture and tradition, We could find a lot of colors and different designs, we want
        you to feel free to navigate and feel enthusiasm every time you see the different products we would
        like to offer, also combine your style with this new way to look.
        The idea of this web page is that the people who enter fall in love with the designs and the Mexican
        culture that will be printed on each of the ties and some designs of different products, we believe
        that it would be very important to promote more talent and national products to help the country 
        and also so that everyone can see that the local product is equal to or better than the conventional
        one, we will try to have the best possible variety so that customers have many options for any 
        type of outfit
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>[Catalogue]</h3>
      <p>
        The difference that we will have with the others is the originality and innovation in our designs,
         the idea of a product made entirely by hand at home can be a very important factor to make it 
         known that each of the products is made with a special and specific dedication, we will also try 
         to improve customer service and the packaging and distribution experience, we believe that you 
         should fall in love from the first sight, that is why we seek to provide the best in packaging 
         and unpacking.
      </p>
      <p>
        The variety of our products will be mainly focused on the sale of ties, bows and accessories for
         men, however we know that the opportunities can be very diverse and we want to be able to cover 
         as many people as possible, we hope that through the demand and innovation, we can expand our 
         designs and catalog to a wider variety of products for different markets and ages, so that 
         everyone has the opportunity to enjoy wearing a piece of Mexican culture.

      <h3>[About us]</h3>
      <p>
        Contact with customers is very important to know about the quality of our products and how we can 
        improve as a company, we hope that our main market will be Mexicans who are proud of the ancient 
        cultures of our country, so they are also participants in this idea, we want to have contact with 
        others through any of our social networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that sharing about us can also be a good factor to create a link with others, being 
        transparent is always going to be a good idea to connect with others and that they have enough 
        confidence to order their products with us, we hope to have dynamics also to meet others and create a
        good community with which to be able to interact in some moments of the company's history, in 
        addition our information will be important so that the location of the store is known so that those
        who may have the opportunity can come to see and know the products in a more direct way.
